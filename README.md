[Beyond deep fakes: Transforming video content into another video's style, automatically](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180911083145.htm)

[Can you tell a fake video from a real one?](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-27/fake-news-part-one/10308638)

These are two particularly interesting articles regarding a new and emerging technology referred to as "deepfakes". The first of which provides more technical aspects of the technology, while the latter provides an actual look at what the product looks like, and how difficult it can be to distinguish a real video from a fake one. Video and photo editing is nothing new to us, we have done CGI and Photoshop for decades, but the most notable part is that these videos are all done without much work being put into them. A software can simply read the video and create a near indistinguishable fake one from that. There are both good and bad implications of such advanced software: while it can potentially mean quicker and cheaper production of videos and movies, it can also mean an influx of fake videos where we may not want there to be. Regardless, the technology remains fascinating.
